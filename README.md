# Image-Classification
I am beginning an end-to-end machine learning project or data science project for sports celebrity image classification. During this project, I will give you a feel of how projects are executed in big companies in a typical corporate environment. We will try to classify an image of my favorite 5 sportspeople.

1) I will build an end-to-end machine learning or data science project
2) Use the OpenCV library for face and eye detection
3) Data cleaning using OpenCV face detection and feature engineering using wavelet transforms
4) Model building using SVM, logistic regression, randomForest
5) Model fine tunning using gridsearchcv
6) Export the model to a file and write a Python Flask server around it that can serve HTTP requests generated by UI
7) Build UI using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery
8) MLflow streamlines the machine learning lifecycle by providing a unified platform for experiment tracking, model development, deployment, and collaboration.
9) MLOps for deployment and CI/CD Pipeline
10) ZenML for Pipeline Orchestration
