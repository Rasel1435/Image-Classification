# Image-Classification
I am beginning an end-to-end machine learning project or data science project for sports celebrity image classification. During this project, I will give you a feel of how projects are executed in big companies in a typical corporate environment. We will try to classify an image of my favorite 5 sportspeople.

## Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
8) MLflow streamlines the machine learning lifecycle by providing a unified platform for experiment tracking, model development, deployment, and collaboration.
9) MLOps for deployment and CI/CD Pipeline
10) ZenML for Pipeline Orchestration
11) AWS for deployment
12) Docker for Dockerize to create images

#### In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,
1) Maria Sharapova
2) Serena Williams
3) Virat Kohli
4) Roger Federer
5) Lionel Messi

## Here is the folder structure,
* UI: This contains UI website code 
* server: Python flask server
* model: Contains Python notebook for model building
* google_image_scrapping: code to scrap Google for images
* images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training

## What I will do in this project:
1) I will build an end-to-end machine learning or data science project
2) Use the OpenCV library for face and eye detection
3) Data cleaning using OpenCV face detection and feature engineering using wavelet transforms
4) Model building using SVM, logistic regression, randomForest
5) Model fine tunning using gridsearchcv
6) Export the model to a file and write a Python Flask server around it that can serve HTTP requests generated by UI
7) Build UI using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery
